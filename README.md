### BFS_and_A_star_9-puzzle_game.py
A script to find the best solution of the game Taquin by applying BFS and A-star search algorithms on its state graph. The states are represented by strings such as 123456789. The goal state is defined as 123456789 where 9 is the empty square.
### minimax_board_game.py
An application of minimax in a board game. Minimax algorithm needs to well define the heuristic value for each state. We have tried several methods to evaluate the state and finally chosen the combination of some of them. After tuning the parameters in these methods, we get a performance that seems reasonable and intelligble. Besides, we have developed several features to dynamically adjust the depth and the intensity of the search to speed up the calculation or break the deadlock.
